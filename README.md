# IKFergusonAddingNumbers

Isaiah Keith Ferguson

This App. will prompt the user for 2 integers and will return an out the total of both numbers.

Peer Review: Richard Johnson - The program works great! I noticed that, rather than immediately looping, 
the user is told to either press Enter to replay, or to type "End" first. I think that's a good feature to add.
The program also checks if the user is entering numbers or not, and responds differently if you type letters or
words rather than numbers in the console.
